Introduction
After dicovering data analytics in 2011, I have always been interested in making better business decisions using this technique. 
My journey in business analytics started when I curated an excel sheet for my friend's retail business. 
I had configured it to calculate her profits without expressly having to do so. 
I also told her i'd analyse the data at the end of the month to see her best customers, products sold and any other insight she needed.
Customer churn interested me when I started looking into prevalent problems for businessses. The cost of customer aquisition almost 4 times the cost of retention strategies. 
I knew i wanted to develop a technique that will help businesses keep their customers by predicting churn. 
I wish to do this with many industries but i chose to start with telecommunications.
This project is about customer churn in the teleommunications industry using hybrid deep learning approach, which was then compared to other conventional models.
