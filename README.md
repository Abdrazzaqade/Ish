**Brief Introduction**
After discovering data analytics in 2011, I have always been interested in making better business decisions using this technique. 
My journey in business analytics started when I curated an Excel sheet for my friend's retail business. 
I had configured it to calculate her profits without expressly having to do so. 
I also told her I'd analyse the data at the end of the month to see her best customers, products sold, and any other insight she needed.
Customer churn interested me when I started looking into prevalent problems for businesses. The cost of customer acquisition is almost 4 times the cost of retention strategies. 
I knew I wanted to develop a technique that would help businesses keep their customers by predicting churn. 
I wish to do this with many industries, but I chose to start with telecommunications.
This project is about customer churn in the telecommunications industry using a hybrid deep learning approach, which was then compared to other conventional models.

Rapid growth and advancements in the telecoms sector has led to an increase in competition often leading to change in customer preferences.
Hence, customer churn, where customers switch providers, is a major challenge. Predictive analytics, including machine and deep learning, has been used to predict churn and aid decisions on customer retention.
````````````````````````````````````````````````````**Statement of the Problem**
Customer satisfaction and retention are pivotal for business success, especially in the telecommunications sector, where preventing customer churn is crucial. Customer churn is a profoundly genuine problem for telecommunications companies, with over 5% monthly and a cost of over Â£40 cost to acquire a new customer. Research has shown that acquiring a new customer costs five times more than retaining active customers. A reduction in the churn rate by 5% can increase profit by three times as much.

This project sought out:
1. To explore the most prominent features and hyperparameters that have been used to train models for customer churn prediction.
2. To determine the best model for customer churn prediction by evaluating the performance of proposed model and traditional machine learning models.
